# 365-multiplayer-projects_info

## INFO
    - here I will post links to the projects
    - start date: 2022-01-01

## GOAL
    - every day, build one multiplayer project

## SYSTEM
    - create a folder with incrementing number
    - build small multiplayer project using at least 1 tech and 1 concept:
        - linkedin and other job posting sites can be used to source techs/softwares to integrate (ex.: Bootstrap, Material UI)
        - techs:
            - React
            - Redux
            - Bootstrap
            - TypeScript
            - Node JS
            - Socket IO
            - python
            - Phaser
            - Colyseus
            - Bootstrap
            - Material UI
            - uWebSocketsJS
        - concepts:
            - tick rates
                - Being able to adjust tick rate in realtime would be super useful
                - Every AAA multiplayer game has different rates, and some work better than others depending on the genre
            - interpolation (lerp)
            - delay to process actions (simulation on oter client happens 1 second later)
            - client-side prediction
    - onComplete():
        - populate readme or a notes.txt file with notes on the project (date of completion, roughly how long it took, main tech stack, others)
            - date of completion
            - time it took
            - main tech(s) used (ex.: most of the time, JS, CSS, and HTML are implied, therefore irrelevant to note)
            - concept(s) used

Note: some projects I have spent multiple days on because they house multiple networking concepts.<br>
